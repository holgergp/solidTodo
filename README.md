[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3fa0b7d5-e6bb-4e45-af12-c6a4adea3911/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/solidjs-todo/deploys)

This is just an implementation of a todo-app in solidjs.

You can have a look at it [here](https://solidjs-todo.netlify.app/).

Below you can find the docs provided by the solid-template.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
